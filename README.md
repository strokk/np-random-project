Investigation into numpy.random


# GMIT - Programming for Data Analysis - Project 2018

## Author: Guilherme G. C. Paes 


### Project Description

Number|Description
-----|-----------
**1**|Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diﬀerent variables.
**2**|Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other
**3**|Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible
**4**|Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

### SUMMARY ABOUT THE NUMPY.RANDOM PROJECT


  This project concerns an investigation about the random function from the numpy package using jupyter notebook.

  For gathering all the necessary information to complete this project I used as an guideline the original SciPy.org documentation in the section of Random Sampling (numpy.random). [1]


  From there I have used Jupyter notebook [2] to proceed with my investigation , and in case you require assistance installing and running Jupyter notebook to read this investigation, please follow the instructions on the reference link. [3]
